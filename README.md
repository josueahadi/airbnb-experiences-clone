# Airbnb Experiences Page Clone

## Overview


This project is a clone of the Airbnb Experiences page. I'm using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The primary goal of this project is to replicate the dynamic behavior of the Airbnb Experiences page, where components are rendered based on underlying data.

## Features

- <strong>Dynamic Data Rendering:</strong> The list of experiences displayed on the page is dynamically generated based on data stored in Airbnb's database. Each component on the page is rendered according to the data that underlies it.

- <strong>Component Creation:</strong> The project includes a function that creates components from an array of data. Whenever the data behind the experience cards changes, the corresponding components are automatically updated, ensuring that the page always displays up to date information.


## Technologies Used
- <strong>React</strong>: For building the user interface and managing component state.
- <strong>Vite:</strong> For fast development and optimized production builds.
- <strong>Tailwind CSS:</strong> For styling and layout, providing a utility-first approach to design.
